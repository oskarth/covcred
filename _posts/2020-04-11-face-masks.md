## Claim

> “If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.”

Claim made by WHO on their [official website](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks). The claim is current. No retraction has been published.

This implies that it wouldn't be better if most people wore masks a precaution.

## Counter

Several studies and successful policies of countries contradict this policy recommendation.

## Verdict and comments

The original claim is misleading and wrong and has a big impact.

The claim influences many policies that have prevented the adoption of mask usage. Usually it is accompanied by the following statements:

1) We need to save masks for health care workers
2) They aren't the only thing we need, they might not work perfectly
3) People might use them wrong

1) is neglecting that masks can be done DIY, and mask production can be ramped up.
2) falls on its face, neither do seat belts work 100% but we wear them and are better off.
3) the answer to this is is basic education, such as their previous educational videos. They are also making it out to be rocket science, which it isn't. Look at every day usage in East Asia.
